# SNB-Neo4j2025

This repository contains a set of validated physical design strategies that optimize data search in graph-oriented databases. The proposed strategies are Query Rewriting, Path Materialization and Index Creation, which were implemented for the 25 queries of the SNB Business Interactive Workload group. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed physical design strategies were validated through experimentation. 

These experiments are part of the  project "Evaluating the Impact of Physical Design on Performance and Energy Consumption in Graph Databases"
